# Meta Hub Main repo
Main repo for the Code for NL "Meta Hub" [Community Project](https://www.codefor.nl/communityprojects).

## The Idea

Meta Hub is a Marketplace for Code for NL community members to find community projects. We create tools for community projects to create a profile, so they can be found.

Meta Hub is also a Marketplace for Code for NL community projects to find community members. We create tools for community members to create a profile, so they can be found.

## Design Principles

1. micro-application: we create micro-applications that are compattible
2. open standards: we use open standards as much as possible
3. user owned data: you may put your data files on github, or on your own website (and we will only cache it (temporarily) for optimization)

## How we work
We will be using the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/) in cobination with the [Shape Up Methodology](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).
